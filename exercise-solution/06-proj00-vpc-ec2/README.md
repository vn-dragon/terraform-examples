Steps for implementation:

1. Deploy a VPC and a subnet
2. Deploy an internet gateway and associate it with the VPC
3. Setup a route table with a route to the IGW and associate it with the subnet
4. Deploy an EC2 instance inside of the created subnet and associate a public IP
5. Associate a security group that allows public ingress
6. Change the EC2 instance to use a publicly available NGINX AMI
7. Destroy everything
